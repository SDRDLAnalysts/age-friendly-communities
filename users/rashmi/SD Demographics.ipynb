    "# San Diego County Demographics\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographics data files for San Diego county contain information pertaining to population numbers per age-group (including 65+) that are needed by the [Age Friendly Communities (AFC)](http://www.sandiegodata.org/projects/age-friendly-communities/) project.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "[SANDAG](http://www.sandag.org/) provides access to the following types of demographics data:  \n",
    "* **Census**  \n",
    "  This data is based on actual US census data\n",
    "* **Estimates**  \n",
    "  These are estimates based on the most recent census data and are released annually from the most recent census year\n",
    "* **Forecasts**  \n",
    "  These are based on models that take estimates and forecast them to longer term durations, typically in 5-year intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was downloaded via SANDAG's [Data Surfer](http://datasurfer.sandag.org/) interface. For the purpose of this project it was deemed that data on a Sub-Regional Area (SRA) basis was the best option. Demographics data specific to an SRA can be downloaded as a standalone Excel file or PDF. The Data Surfer interface currently does not allow downloading data for multiple locations (be it SRAs or otherwise) as a single file.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Each set of 41 Excel files pertaining to either census, estimate or forecast data is available as an archive (zip file) in the AFC shared drive. The script below collates data from each of the SRA specific Excel files into a single CSV file for each type of demographics data. The collated CSVs have been converted into MetaTab documents and made available in the drive."
